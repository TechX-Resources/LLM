# LLM from Scratch Cohort

Welcome to the LLM from Scratch cohort! This repository contains resources, code, and materials for learning about Large Language Models from the ground up.

## üéØ Course Overview

This cohort is designed to help you understand and implement Large Language Models from scratch. We'll cover everything from the fundamentals of neural networks to building and fine-tuning your own LLM.

## üìö Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Git for version control

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch
- **Tokenization**: Hugging Face Tokenizers
- **Model Architecture**: Transformer-based
- **Training**: Distributed training with PyTorch DDP
- **Evaluation**: Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE metrics

## üîß Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv llm-env
source llm-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: llm-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ü§ñ AI Provider Integration

### OpenAI API Integration
```python
import openai

# Initialize OpenAI client
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"  # Store this securely in environment variables

def get_openai_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=150
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None
```

### Hugging Face Integration
```python
from transformers import pipeline, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

def setup_huggingface_model(model_name="gpt2"):
    # Load model and tokenizer
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    # Create text generation pipeline
    generator = pipeline('text-generation', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
    return generator

def generate_text(prompt, max_length=50):
    generator = setup_huggingface_model()
    return generator(prompt, max_length=max_length)[0]['generated_text']
```

### Google Cloud AI Platform
```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

def initialize_vertex_ai(project_id, location="us-central1"):
    aiplatform.init(project=project_id, location=location)

def get_vertex_ai_prediction(endpoint_id, instances):
    endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(endpoint_name=endpoint_id)
    return endpoint.predict(instances)
```
